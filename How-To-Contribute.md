# Contributing to Gotta Spark Em All

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

### Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation. (Documentation Link Coming Soon)
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Report bugs using Github's issues
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

### Document Changes
Document changes are made in [repo coming soon] as opposed to directly in the Wiki. This allows for Pull Requests to the Wiki.
